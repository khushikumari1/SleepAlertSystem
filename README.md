Drowsy driving is a significant problem on the roads, causing many accidents and fatalities every year. To help address this issue, a sleep alert system has been developed using IoT technology. The system uses wearable glasses to monitor the driverâ€™s eye movements and detect when they close their eyes for more than three seconds. If the driver is detected to be sleeping frequently, the system will activate a buzzer to alert the driver, and the car will enter a sleep mode, where it will only be able to go to a parking spot with limited fuel and remain at a halt for 20 minutes. In the future, collaborative processing and image processing will be used to detect whether the driver is sleeping or not, and a jerk in the seat will help to bring the driver to consciousness. GPS technology is also used to analyze data and provide suggestions for petrol pumps, restaurants, hospitals, and security purposes. This sleep alert system has the potential to significantly reduce accidents caused by drowsy driving and improve overall road safety.
